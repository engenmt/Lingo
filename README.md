# Lingo

*The Riddler* is a column on [fivethirtyeight.com](fivethirtyeight.com). The week of January 29, 2021, [they announced](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-guess-the-mystery-word/) a puzzle based on the game show [Lingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(American_game_show)), in which the goal was to preselect four five-letter words to optimize your chance at guessing the mystery word. This is my code to seek a solution.

Announced in [the following week's post](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-randomly-move-the-tower/), my words (CLIPT, GYBED, KHOUM, WARNS) were the seventh-best submitted, giving way to a 95.48% chance at correctly guessing the mystery word.
